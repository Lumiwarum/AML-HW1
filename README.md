## Files

In this repo you can find .ipynb files with trained YOLOv8n and Faster RCCN on detectron2 (R50-FPN)

There are also 2 reports for failed and current (successful) solutions. 

Itâ€™s better to read them in chronological order as follows:

1. Failed_solution.pdf
2. Current_solution.pdf

All steps of the work are described in them

No files except the report are related to the failed solution, it just helps to understand why in the end I choose the current solution
